## Development Process
Task Management: Used Jira to plan and manage tasks, and assign tasks to divide the project between us.
Version Control: Used Git with feature branches and pull requests for code review.
UI Design: Followed Android's material design principles, using XML for layout design.
Separation of Logic: Ensured a separation from design by implementing application logic in Java.

This Android application is our first step towards a fully functional YouTube platform for android use.
